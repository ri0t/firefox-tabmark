TabMark
=======

Unclutters your 500+ tabs by removing useless junk and bookmarking the rest,
then closing them.

Setup
=====

KillTabs
--------

First, select tabs you want regularly killed, e.g. news sites or other urls
you don't want bookmarked and add them to the KillTabs List by clicking the
TabMarks button (suitcase with a bookmark), then "Add to KillTabs".

Preferences
-----------

In Firefox' AddOn settings for TabMarks, you can select whether to reduce the
task by automatically killing all KillTabs before Bookmarking.
There is also a setting to not close the bookmarked tabs, which is rather 
pointless.
